Where Artificial Intelligence Meets Energy Efficiency.

Residential Energy Consumption Forecasting: A model to predict a household's energy demand based on historical smart meter data, time of day, seasonal changes, and potentially occupancy behavior.

Building HVAC Optimization: Use sensor data (temperature, occupancy) and external weather data to train an ML model that optimizes heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems in a building to minimize energy use while maintaining comfort.
